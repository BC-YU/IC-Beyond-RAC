This repository contains the programs used in the paper "Information causality beyond the random access code model".

The program "IC_Boudaries" is used for calculating the IC boundaries in Figure 1.

The program "2-2-2HeuMix" is used for the heuristic optimisation of IC_red values.

The program "ExtremeICred" is used for the sampling of IC_red values over 2-2-2 extremal quantum correlations.

The program "2-2-2ICred" is used for the sampling of IC_red values over 2-2-2 mixed quantum correlations.
